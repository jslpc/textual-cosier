Sulaco Textual Style
====================

Sulaco is a dark theme for the [Textual IRC client](https://www.codeux.com/textual/). Based slightly to [Sulaco](https://github.com/rgrove/textual-sulaco). As usual, I needed something different.

## Features

* Easy on the eyes.

* Looks great with a wide variety of fonts. My favorite is Lucida Grande
  14pt, which is just gorgeous on a Retina display.

* Coalesces multiple consecutive messages from the same sender rather than
  displaying the same nickname over and over.

* Provides handy start and end markers for ZNC playback.

* Plucks the ugly in-message timestamps out of ZNC playback and puts them in the timestamp column where they belong.

## Installing

1. [Download the Cosy theme](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/textual-cosy/archive/master.zip)

2. Open Textual's preferences. Go to Addons->Installed Addons and click the
   "Open in Finder" button next to the "Custom Addons Location" label.

3. Browse to Textual's `Styles` directory.

4. Extract the Cosy theme here, into its own folder (rename it if you don't
   like GitHub's autogenerated archive name).
